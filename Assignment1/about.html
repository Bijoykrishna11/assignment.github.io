    <p>Mohammad Mahmudullah[5] (Bengali: ‡¶Æ‡ßã‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶¶ ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶π‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶¶‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶π; born 4 February 1986), also known as Riyad,[5] is a Bangladeshi cricketer and former captain of the Bangladesh national cricket team in T20I. He has played First-class and List A cricket for Dhaka Division and has represented Bangladesh in all forms of the game. An all-rounder, he is a lower or middle-order batsman as well as an off spin bowler. He has almost 10,000 runs and 150+ wickets. He is prominent for his ability to finish a close limited over game. He is the first Bangladeshi to score a World Cup hundred (3 hundreds in ICC events including back to back hundreds against England and New Zealand).[6][7] Like Sanath Jayasuriya, Kevin Pietersen, Shoaib Malik, Steve Smith and many more, Mahmudullah started his career as a bowler and then converted into a batsman who could bowl handy off-breaks.</p>
